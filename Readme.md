# A PureScript Mercury Parser wrapper

This is an early stage implementation of a PureScript wrapper for the [Mercury Parser](https://github.com/postlight/mercury-parser) v2.2.0.

Basic functionality including parsing with basic options changed works reliably.

Note that since package is still in early development so the API might change in drastic ways.

See "wrapper implementation notes" in the documentation for information about implementation details and functionality that has not been implemented or fully tested yet, in particular on `ParserOptions`, `CustomParser`, and `ContentExtractor`.
